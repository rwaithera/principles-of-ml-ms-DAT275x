Dummy variables encode categorical features as a set of binary variables. There is one dummy variable for each possible category. For each case all of the values in the dummy variables are set to zero, except the one corresponding to the category value, which is set to one. In this way, a categorical variable with any number of categories can be encoded as series of numeric features which scikit-learn can operate on. This process is referred to as **one hot encoding** since only one dummy variable is coded as 1 (hot) per case. \n\nThe `sklearn.preprocessing` package contains functions to encode categorical features as dummy variables in two steps;\n1. The categories are  encoded as numbers starting with 0. For example, if there are 5 categories, they are encoded as the set $\\{ 0,1,2,3,4 \\}$.\n2. The numeric categories are then encoded as dummy variables. \n\nThe following example will give you a feel for how this process works. The code in the cell below computes the numeric representation of the categories for the `body_style` feature by the following steps:\n\n1. An encoder object is created using the `LabelEncoder` method.\n2. The encoder is `fit` to the unique string values of the feature. \n3.
